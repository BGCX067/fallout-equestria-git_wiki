= Compiling on Windows =
On Windows, you must compile using the Visual Studio compiler (Panda3D does not support MinGW).
This project uses C++11, so you should set the corresponding option on your compiler.

= Compiling on Linux =
There's a CMake file at the root of the git repository. Install the cmake package if it's not already done.

Go into the build directory, and type 'cmake ..' to generate the Makefile.
Once it's over, type 'make' to compile the project.

= Executing =
You must execute the game from the "build" directory.
