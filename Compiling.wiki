#summary How to compile the project from the source

= Installing the dependencies =

Download and compile the dependencies from the following links.

*Panda3D 1.8.0 / 1.8.x CVS*

http://www.panda3d.org/download.php?sdk&version=1.8.0

However, I recommand to use the devlopment vesrion (CVS) if you can. The Rocket's module in 1.8.0 has a critical bug with the drag'n'drop feature, and we use it for inventory management.
If you already have a 1.8.0 compiled or installed, it's not that terrible, you just have to remember not to drag and drop items (or you will witness the might of the segmentation fault).

_Careful Windows users: our code uses C++11 features only supported since MSVC2010: you need the unstable Panda3D 1.9.0 to compile on Windows._

*LibRocket 1.2.1*

*AngelScript == 2.25*

= Compiling on Windows =
It was pretty hard to make it happen, but the game can build on Windows,
and since it might not be that easy to do, we have a whole wiki page
talking about it:

= Compiling on Linux =
There's a CMake file at the root of the git repository.

Make sure you have all the dependencies installed first (cmake, panda3d, librocket, angelscript).

Go into the build directory, and type 'cmake ..' to generate the Makefile.
Once it's over, type 'make' to compile the project.

= Executing =
You must execute the game from the "build" directory.
